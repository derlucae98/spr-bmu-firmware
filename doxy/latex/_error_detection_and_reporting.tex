S32 SDK drivers can use a mechanism to validate data coming from upper software layers (application code) by performing a number of checks on input parameters\textquotesingle{} range or other invariants that can be statically checked (not dependent on runtime conditions).

A failed validation is indicative of a software bug in application code, therefore it is important to use this mechanism during development.

The validation is performed by using DEV\+\_\+\+ASSERT macro. A default implementation of this macro is provided in this file. However, application developers can provide their own implementation in a custom file. This requires defining the CUSTOM\+\_\+\+DEVASSERT symbol with the specific file name in the project configuration (for example\+: -\/DCUSTOM\+\_\+\+DEVASSERT=\char`\"{}custom\+\_\+devassert.\+h\char`\"{})

The default implementation accommodates two behaviors, based on DEV\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+DETECT symbol\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When DEV\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+DETECT symbol is defined in the project configuration (for example\+: -\/DDEV\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+DETECT), the validation performed by the DEV\+\_\+\+ASSERT macro is enabled, and a failed validation triggers a software breakpoint and further execution is prevented (application spins in an infinite loop) This configuration is recommended for development environments, as it prevents further execution and allows investigating potential problems from the point of error detection.
\item When DEV\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+DETECT symbol is not defined, the DEV\+\_\+\+ASSERT macro is implemented as no-\/op, therefore disabling all validations. This configuration can be used to eliminate the overhead of development-\/time checks.
\end{DoxyItemize}

It is the application developer\textquotesingle{}s responsibility to decide the error detection strategy for production code\+: one can opt to disable development-\/time checking altogether (by not defining DEV\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+DETECT symbol), or one can opt to keep the checks in place and implement a recovery mechanism in case of a failed validation, by defining CUSTOM\+\_\+\+DEVASSERT to point to the file containing the custom implementation.
